# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Version 3 of the String to CSV Converter Chrome extension will introduce advanced data processing capabilities, enhanced user experience features, and improved performance optimizations. Building upon the solid foundation of v2.5, this version will add batch processing, multi-column data processing, data validation, export options, and integration capabilities while maintaining the extension's core simplicity and efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Data Processing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Batch Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide options to process multiple inputs simultaneously
2. WHEN the user uploads a file (TXT, CSV, JSON) THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the format and suggest appropriate conversion settings
3. WHEN the user enables "Smart Detection" THEN the system SHALL automatically identify the best separator and quote type based on input analysis
4. IF the input contains mixed data types THEN the system SHALL provide data type validation and conversion options
5. WHEN processing large datasets (>1MB) THEN the system SHALL use web workers to prevent UI blocking

### Requirement 2: Advanced Export and Import Capabilities

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to export my converted data in multiple formats and import from various sources, so that I can integrate with different tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Export" THEN the system SHALL offer options for CSV, TSV, JSON, and Excel formats
2. WHEN the user selects "Import from URL" THEN the system SHALL fetch and process data from web endpoints
3. WHEN the user chooses "Save Template" THEN the system SHALL store conversion settings as reusable templates
4. IF the user imports a file larger than 10MB THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting options and metadata

### Requirement 3: Multi-Column Data Processing

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to process multi-column tabular data with flexible row and column separators, so that I can convert structured text data into properly formatted CSV.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Multi-Column Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated tab for processing tabular data
2. WHEN the user pastes multi-column data THEN the system SHALL automatically detect potential column and row separators
3. WHEN the user configures row separators THEN the system SHALL support newline, custom characters, or regex patterns
4. WHEN the user configures column separators THEN the system SHALL support tabs, spaces, pipes, custom characters, or multiple consecutive separators
5. WHEN processing tabular data THEN the system SHALL provide a preview grid showing how data will be parsed
6. IF the data has inconsistent column counts THEN the system SHALL handle missing values and provide padding options
7. WHEN the user enables "Header Detection" THEN the system SHALL identify and preserve header rows in the CSV output

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want an improved interface with better accessibility and productivity features, so that I can work more efficiently and comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension THEN the system SHALL display a redesigned interface with improved information architecture
2. WHEN the user enables "Compact Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide a streamlined view for quick conversions
3. WHEN the user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
4. IF the user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL provide high contrast themes and screen reader compatibility
5. WHEN the user performs frequent actions THEN the system SHALL offer customizable keyboard shortcuts
6. WHEN the user works with large outputs THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities within results

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a data professional, I want built-in validation and quality checks, so that I can ensure data integrity and catch errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables "Data Validation" THEN the system SHALL check for common data quality issues (duplicates, empty values, format inconsistencies)
2. WHEN validation errors are found THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic data and suggest corrections
3. WHEN the user processes email lists THEN the system SHALL validate email format and flag invalid entries
4. IF the input contains potential PII THEN the system SHALL warn the user and offer anonymization options
5. WHEN the user converts numeric data THEN the system SHALL detect and preserve number formatting and validate ranges

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability Improvements

**User Story:** As a power user, I want faster processing and better memory management, so that I can handle larger datasets without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing datasets larger than 1MB THEN the system SHALL use streaming processing to maintain responsiveness
2. WHEN the user works with multiple conversions THEN the system SHALL implement memory pooling to prevent memory leaks
3. WHEN the extension starts up THEN the system SHALL load in under 200ms for improved user experience
4. IF the system detects performance issues THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest optimization settings
5. WHEN processing complex operations THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback and ETA

### Requirement 7: Advanced Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want granular control over conversion settings and the ability to create custom processing rules, so that I can handle specialized data transformation needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses "Advanced Settings" THEN the system SHALL provide options for custom regex patterns and transformation rules
2. WHEN the user creates custom rules THEN the system SHALL allow saving and organizing rules in categories
3. WHEN the user enables "Preview Mode" THEN the system SHALL show real-time preview of transformations before applying
4. IF the user needs specific formatting THEN the system SHALL support custom date/time formats and number formatting
5. WHEN the user works with structured data THEN the system SHALL provide options for nested object flattening and expansion

### Requirement 8: Integration and API Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the extension with external tools and automate workflows, so that I can build efficient data processing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables "API Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide a local API endpoint for programmatic access
2. WHEN external applications need conversion services THEN the system SHALL support message passing for cross-extension communication
3. WHEN the user connects to external services THEN the system SHALL support OAuth authentication for secure API access
4. IF the user needs automation THEN the system SHALL provide webhook support for triggered conversions
5. WHEN integrating with cloud services THEN the system SHALL support popular platforms like Google Sheets, Airtable, and Zapier
